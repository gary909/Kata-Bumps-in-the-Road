    <p>
        Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps <br>
        before it dies totally.<br>
<br>
        Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (_) or bumps (n). If you are <br>
        able to reach home safely by encountering 15 bumps or less, return Woohoo!, otherwise return Car Dead<br>
